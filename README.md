# Vange

### Setup

Requirements:

* cmake
* Shared library injector 
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
* [Library injector](https://github.com/scen/osxinj) (I'm suggesting this not saying only this will work I will not explain how to build it)

To generate the project files:

* **Mac OS**: `cmake`

To build:

* **Mac OS**: `make`

Injection can be done by injecting with your favorite shared library injector.
* **Example**: `sudo ./osxinj csgo_osx64 libVange.dylib`

###### Note: The person updating this aka me (Warlauke) wants to let you know that this Barbossa paste is really bad when it comes to some things and its more or less the base version of Barbossa with a different resolver and a skinchanger added onto it.
